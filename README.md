# Miles-Per-Gallon

In this repository I analyze the Miles per gallon dataset and at last I build ML model to predict MPG value.Following are the process which I performed while dealing with this dataset.<br/>
<br/>
1) Firstly,I performed exploratory data analysis in which I clean the data and get the insights of data by plotting graphs(by using seaborn,matplotlib).<br/>
<br/>
2) Secondly,I performed statistcal analysis in which I try to find independencies between categorical features and correlation between numerical variable.<br/>
<br/>
3) At last,I did predictive modelling in which I trained various model and at the end chose the best model which fit the data perfectly.<br/>
