# Miles-Per-Gallon

## Overview
In this repository I analyze the Miles per gallon dataset and at last I build ML model to predict MPG value.Following are the process which I performed while dealing with this dataset.


1) Firstly,I performed exploratory data analysis in which I clean the data and get the insights of data by plotting graphs(by using seaborn,matplotlib).
2) Secondly,I performed statistcal analysis in which I try to find independencies between categorical features and correlation between numerical variable.
3) At last,I did predictive modelling in which I trained various model and at the end chose the best model which fit the data perfectly.

## How to run
In making of this project I have used Flask framework for web app.
Following step should be follow in order to get the app running

1)Clone the repository into your working directory.

2)Ensure that all the libraries mentioned in the requirement.txt should be installed beforehand.

3)At last run app.py and check your localhost(http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to get the web app.
